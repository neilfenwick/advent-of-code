# Advent of code 2021

Brushing up my Go code skills. I've started reading "Effective Go" and probably write more idiomatic Go code than I did a year ago. This
year has generally felt easier to write in Go.

âš  Not everything is perfectly tested. I've used tests where they helped me think my way through a problem.  I have also intentionally ignored some error conditions because I know that the advent-of-code input is clean. I know that I can get away with that here, whereas I would have needed to be more defensive if the input was not so controlled.

Otherwise, this year, I'm really just trying to solve the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems, and have a little fun learning while I do so ðŸŽ„

Interesting thoughts that I've had or new things that I've learned:

- How to write more readable Go - [Workshop: Practical Go - GoSG Meetup - Dave Cheney][workshop]
- A generally held opinion is that global state should be avoided. I agree. Up until about day 12, I  had used a few package variables, like maps, in places where the global state isn't long lived (even in just a simple "run-once" CLI application). In a server, global / shared state can be dangerous and result in state leaking between requests, etc.

- [Waitgroups][waitgroups] are an easier way to keep track of when concurrent goroutines complete
