# Advent of code 2021

Brushing up my Go code skills. I still haven't read "Effective Go" yet and I probably don't write idiomatic Go code. This
year has generally felt easier to write in Go, compared to previous years.

âš  Not everything is perfectly tested.

I'm really just trying to solve the Advent-of-code problems and have a little fun
learning while I do it.
