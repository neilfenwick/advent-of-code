# Advent of code

Combined repository for all years of the Advent of Code coding puzzles.
I've used these as a bit of a hobby playground for getting familiar with Go
and learning to write more idiomatic code.

I haven't sovled all of these in the most expedient way possible, but rather used them as an exercise to think about how
I would approach the problem if it was a scalable real-world problem.

e.g. try to avoid buffering the entire input into memory wherever possible.
